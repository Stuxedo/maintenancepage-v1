# Changelog

All notable changes to maintenancepage-v1 are documented here.

## v1.0.2

### Fixed

- The footer's copyright line had a second, hidden copy of the © icon inside its screen-reader text; it's gone, leaving the visible icon and a plain "©" for screen readers. Nothing changes on screen

## v1.0.1

### Fixed

- The footer no longer says "Stuxedo is operated by Stux.Cloud, which is operated by Stux Group Ltd."; that belongs on the Imprint, which still says who operates the page. The copyright line names Stuxedo instead of Stux.Group ("© 2026 Stuxedo. All rights reserved."), matching the live pages

## v1.0.0

### Added

- Archived [Stuxedo/maintenancepage](https://github.com/Stuxedo/maintenancepage) at commit `f094e68` (`v1.2.2`), the last state before Stuxedo's rebrand to the tuxedo-cat logo (neon `#4bf708` on dark, deep `#032f14` on light), preserving history up to that point as this repository's own `main` branch

### Changed

- Served from `maintenancepage-v1.stuxedo.net` instead of `maintenancepage.stuxedo.net` (CNAME, canonical URLs, sitemap and robots.txt)
- Logo, icon and favicon now point at the archived assets under `https://global.media.stuxedo.com/v1/` instead of the live Stuxedo brand assets, which have been replaced
- README and CONTRIBUTING describe this repository as an archive
